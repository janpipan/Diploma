Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 10.177.30.50:8443 --token iq20cy.va3fcdjdj1m5ajhw \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:088a17b08d7e2b8319de4ca94e1f1b95a9bf1989383ec7cdd0bceef58024d991 \
        --control-plane --certificate-key 98afd464d528c4a9c5f1d19266696275cd0a53f637b7c79000a30682b63a206c

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.177.30.50:8443 --token iq20cy.va3fcdjdj1m5ajhw \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:088a17b08d7e2b8319de4ca94e1f1b95a9bf1989383ec7cdd0bceef58024d991
